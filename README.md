There is no argument or debate. What is happening in Gaza & Palestine is ethnic cleansing & genocide. A vast number of rogue states and corrupt corporations around the world are deeply involved in turning the gears of this genocide. It has become alarming clear that those who facilitate have no intention of stopping the massacre of the Palestinian people. We see politicians stand behind podiums and attempt to pander to the voices of decency with nothing but empty words. An immediate cessation of ALL arms aid support and funding to the terrorist entity Israel is the only way to stop this genocide. Therefore, it is not only our right as citizens of the world, but it is our duty to document each and every individual, group, corporation, or any other entity who is involved in this genocide; as well as to make a target of those who are turning the gears of this war machine. The world has stood up to stamp out fascism & apartheid whenever it rears its ugly head; this time is no different.

This repo will serve as a hub of information on parties involved in political Zionism and the terrorist organization Israel. We will be compiling information on all involved parties, including but not limited to: locations of arms manufacturing sites, profiles on companies involved as well as their leaders and employees, politicians who vote in favor of or promote Israeli propaganda, media figures who spread the propaganda and false narratives of the Israeli government, charity organizations as well as other money machines that support the Zionist entity, public figures, and influencers. This information will include ANY and ALL publicly available information and can include home addresses and other contact information.

We believe in a diversity of tactics when fighting against the oppressive forces of this world, even more so when it comes to the terrorist organization Israel and fighting against this genocide in Palestine. We encourage the use of the information contained within these repos to fight against this genocide by any means necessary to make it stop. We take no responsibility for what others may do with the information contained in this repo. We will not be responsible for any damages or injuries caused by the use of this repo.

Long Live Palestine, Long Live Gaza
