A specialty truck manufacturer headquartered in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, Oshkosh manufactures the hulls for the Eitan, Israelâ€™s newest armored personnel carrier, which was used operationally for the first time in the ground invasion of Gaza.
Oshkosh also makes the trucks that Israel converts into the Panther, an armored personnel carrier used extensively in the occupied West Bank.
On Dec. 7, the Israeli military captured dozens of Palestinians in Gaza and transported them to Israel for interrogation. Individuals were stripped down to their underwear and publicly humiliated for hours, potentially in violation of international humanitarian law. At least some were transported in Oshkosh Medium Tactical Vehicles. While Israeli media claimed that these individuals were all members of Hamas, the Israeli military later admitted that the vast majority were civilians.
In addition, Israel acquired 75 Oshkosh Joint Light Tactical Vehicles in November, to be delivered until Sept. 2025. The initial $208 million order was funded by U.S. taxpayers' money. A subsequent modification to the original contract was partially funded by U.S. taxpayers' money, while the rest was funded through Israel's own budget. This order by Israel will keep Oshkosh's JLTVs in production until 2025, longer than the company had originally planned.
