Palantir Technologies

A Denver-based high-tech mass surveillance company that has been providing its AI-powered tools to the Israeli security forces as well as the U.S. military, immigration authorities, and police departments.
Since Oct. 7, it has been "seeing high demand from Israel for new tools," and has been providing Israel with more products than before. In January, it entered a "strategic partnership" with Israel's Ministry of Defense to "help the country's war effort." Palantir CEO Alex Karp said in November, "I am proud that we are supporting Israel in every way we can."
